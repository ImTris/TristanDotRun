# Welcome

On this site I collect and record practical solutions for myself. If you are visiting I hope it helps you as a software engineer.

Over the years, I've worked with many different projects and clients as a senior software engineer. Through this experience, I noticed how valuable it is to have a reliable place for your favorite setups, reference links, and lessons learned. To get up and running as fast as possible. Here I share and maintain my personal configuration for what I deem a productive development environment on any machine. On top of that I keep track of the resources I regularly visit.

As a Microsoft Certified Solutions Architect, I focus on designing scalable, secure cloud solutions and solving complex technical challenges.

You'll find concise, no-nonsense tutorials at my [Blog](/posts/), my personal [Dev Config](/dev-config/) for getting started fast, and a [Knowledge Base](/knowledge-base/) with the best documentation and links I use in my daily work.

Thanks for visiting.
